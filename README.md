# Python
This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Python Certifications:

[Sea Level Predictor](seal-level-predictor): Analyzing a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 and predicting the sea level change through year 2050.

[Page View Time Series Visualizer](time-series-visualizer):  Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016 to 2019.

[Medical Data Visualizer](medical-data-visualizer): Visualizing and making calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.

[Demographic Data Analyzer](demographic-data-analyzer): Analyze ddemographic data to extract information regarding  age, education, occupation, race, and hours worked per week.

[Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator): Created a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

[Probability Calculator](probability-calculator): A program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

[Polygon Area Calculator](polygon-area-calculator): Creating two classes 'rectangle' and  and its subclass 'square' inheriting some methods .

[Budget App](budget-calculator) : Implementing a budget management system using object-oriented programming in Python. The main components are the Category class, designed to handle different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment, and a supporting function called create_spend_chart for visualizing spending percentages.

[Time Calculator](time-calculator) : Simple function to add time and  display time and  the day of the week of the result.

[Arithmetic Formatter](arithmetic-formatter) : A function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side and outputs the result .
